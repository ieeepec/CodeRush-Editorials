CHRISTMAS CANDIES
Every Christmas, Santa Claus brings candies for children. In his bag, there are N packets and each packet has some number of candies in it. Santa wants to give one packet to each child. There are k children and k is always less than equal to n. Santa wants to select packets for dirstirbution such that the total cumulative difference in the number of candies in different packets distributed is minimised. Determine this minimum difference achievable by santa..
For example, he brings n=6 packets where the number of candies is packets=[3,3,4,7,10,12]. There are k=3 children. The minimum difference between all packets can be had with 3,3,4 from indices 0,1 and 2. We must get the difference in the following pairs: {(0,1),(0,2),(1,2)} . We calculate the unfairness sum as:

Packets Candies				
0	3		Indices		Difference	Result
1	3		(0,1),(0,2)	|3-3| + |3-4|	1 
2	4		(1,2)		|3-4|		1

Total = 2

Input:
The first line contains an integer n. The second line contains an integer k. The next n lines contain n sinlge integer denoting packets[i].

Output: 
Print a single integer denoting the minimum achievable unfairness sum.

Constrains:
2 <= n <= 1000
2 <= k <= n
0 <= packets[i] <= 1000

Example:
Sample Input:
7
3
10
100
300
200
1000
20
30

Sample Output:
40

Explanation:
Santa would choose packets having 10,20 and 30 candies.
