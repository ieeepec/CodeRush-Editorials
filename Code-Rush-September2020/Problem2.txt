Sam has a list of stock’s values of different days (The value varies every day). Sam must buy a stock on one day but must resell it on another day, but he must do so at a loss. 
Output the loss if he buys a stock on one day and resells in any of the following days such that the loss is minimized. 
For example,  the values on 3 days (d=3) are [5,10,3]. So, to minimize the loss, he must buy a stock on the first day at value[0]=5 and sell it on the third day at value[2]=3. The loss will be (5-3)=2.

Input Format :
The first line contains an integer d, the number of days.
The second line contains d space-separated long integers describing each value[i].

Constraints :
•	2<=d<=2*(10^5)
•	1<=value[i]<10^16
•	All the values are distinct.
•	A valid answer exists.

Output Format :
Print a single integer denoting the value Sam loses if he buys and resell the stock within the d days.

Sample Input :
5
20 7 8 2 5

Sample Output :
2

Explanation :
Sam buys the stock on 2nd day at value[1]=7 and sells it on 5th day at value[4]=5  incurring a loss of  (7-5)=2.
